ðŸ“ˆ Day 3: Housing Price Prediction - Linear Regression
This is my Day 3 task for the AI/ML Internship program.In this task, I implemented simple and multiple linear regression models on the Housing Price Prediction dataset and created advanced visualizations using Python libraries.

ðŸ“Œ What I Did

Loaded the Housing dataset using Pandas.
Converted categorical variables (e.g., mainroad, furnishingstatus) to numeric using LabelEncoder.


Performed Linear Regression:
Built a simple linear regression model using area as the sole feature.
Built a multiple linear regression model using all available features.


Evaluated models:
Calculated Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ² score.
Exported metrics and coefficients to model_results.txt.


Created visualizations:
Plotted a correlation heatmap to show feature relationships.
Plotted a scatter plot with regression line for simple linear regression (Area vs. Price).
Plotted a bar chart of feature importance for multiple linear regression.
Plotted actual vs. predicted prices for model evaluation.
Combined all plots into a single image, saved as housing_price_analysis.png.


Created interactive visualizations:
Generated an interactive 2D scatter plot using Plotly (Area vs. Price).
Generated an interactive 3D scatter plot using Plotly (Area, Bedrooms vs. Price).
Exported as scatter_plot.html and 3d_scatter_plot.html.
