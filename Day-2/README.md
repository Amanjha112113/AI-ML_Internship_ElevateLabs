# ðŸ“Š Day 2: Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This is my **Day 2 task** for the AI/ML Internship program.  
In this task, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python libraries.

---

## ðŸ“Œ What I Did

1. **Loaded the Titanic dataset** using Pandas.
2. **Generated summary statistics**:
   - Used `describe()` to compute mean, median, std, min, max, etc.
   - Exported to `summary_statistics.csv`.
3. **Visualized distributions**:
   - Plotted histograms and KDEs for all numerical features.
   - Plotted boxplots to identify outliers and data spread.
4. **Created a correlation matrix heatmap**:
   - Identified relationships between numerical features.
5. **Plotted pairplot** for key features:
   - Explored feature interactions colored by survival.
6. **Combined all plots into a single image** using Pillow.
   - Exported as `eda_summary.png`.
