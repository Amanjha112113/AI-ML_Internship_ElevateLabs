# 💻 Daily Learning Progress: AI/ML Intern

Welcome to my daily learning repository! This project is structured to track progress over several days as I explore and practice [insert topic here, e.g., Python programming, Data Structures, Machine Learning, etc.].

Each folder contains content, code, and notes for one specific day. Feel free to explore and follow along!
